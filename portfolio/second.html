    <div class ="text1"><h2>About Me</h2>
      I became a salesman because of people. I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager at a very young age. And I still try to be a friend first.

      I believe in encouraging a light hearted and casual work culture in the places I work.

      <h2> Current Job</h2>
      <b>1992 - present</b>

      <p>I am the Regional Manager at the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin. I have been working at Dunder Mifflin since May 6, 1992.
      <br><br>

      <p>  Briefly, I also formed the Michael Scott Paper Company with Pam Beesly and Ryan Howard (my employees from Dunder Mifflin) toward the end 2008 and shared a co-managerial position with Jim Halpert (another brilliant associate) during 2009.

    <h2> Management style </h2>
  <p>  “Do I have a special someone? Well, yeah of course. A bunch of ’em. My employees.” </p><br>
  I often like to consider the folks at Dunder Mifflin as my extended family. My employees love me and I want to be worthy of that kind of regard.
  I believe it's the bond between us at the Scranton branch that truly makes us the best. I like to be as hands-off as possible, letting my employees
  have freedom to be themselves. We pride ourselves in being inclusive.
